# CellTiter-Glo cell viability assay 

HUVEC cells (C.applications, passage 5) were cultured in white 96-well cell culture plates (Greiner) in 20% FBS containing M199 medium supplemented with 4 mM L-glutamine, 50 µg/ml heparin, 10 mM Hepes, 30 µg/ml ECGS (Millipore).

Synchronous cells: Cells were seeded in 0.1% gelatin-coated white 96-well cell culture plates (Greiner) at density 5000 cells/well. After 24h cells were starved in M199 media supplemented with 1% FBS, 25mM Hepes and 4 mM L-glutamine for overnight (15-16h). After starving cells were incubated  with different concentrations of hIgG1-Fc or  hCD44-3MUT_Fc (0-16 µM) in 5% FBS  containing HUVEC growth media  for 1 h at 37 oC and  thereafter stimulated with 25 ng/ml of VEGF-165 (Serotec), 25 ng/ml of bFGF (Peprotech), 10ng/ml GDF-2 (Peprotech) or 63ng/ml HGF (Peprotech). The cells were further grown for 72h at 37 oC.

Asynchronous cells:  Cells were seeded in 0.1% gelatin-coated white 384-well cell culture plates (Greiner) at density 1000 or 1600 cells/well. After 24h HUVECs were treated with different concentrations of hIgG-Fc or hCD44-3MUT-Fc (0-16 µM) in 10% FBS containing HUVEC growth media for 72h or 96h at 37 oC.  																				

For CellTiter-Glo cell viability assay CellTiter-Glo reagent (equal volume to media) was added to cells, icubated for 10min at RT and luminescence was measured by IVIS and TECAN ELISA plate reader.
